                    contained herein, which reflect a fair and equitable allocation of risk between us and you and
                    constitute an essential basis of the transaction between us and you.</p>
                <h2>9. LIABILITY FOR RISK</h2>
                <ul className="privacy-list list-none">
                    <li><strong>(i) Cost and Volatility:</strong> Prices of blockchain collectibles are highly volatile
                        and subjective, and blockchain collectibles have no inherent or intrinsic value. Collectibles
                        may also be subject to significant price fluctuations when prices fluctuate for other digital
                        assets. Each Collectible has no intrinsic value. We cannot guarantee that Collectibles purchased
                        will maintain their original value, as the value of Collectibles is inherently subjective, and
                        factors outside of the Hyper League ecosystem may significantly affect the value and
                        desirability of a particular Collectible.
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>(ii) Tax Calculation:</strong> You are solely responsible for determining what taxes
                        apply to your transactions with Collectibles. We are not responsible for determining what taxes
                        apply to your transactions on the Platform.
                    </li>
                    <li>(iii) Use of Blockchain: The Platform does not store, send or receive Collectibles. It is
                        because Collectibles only exist through proof of ownership stored on the Blockchain. Any
                        Collectibles transfer occurs within the blockchain and not on the Platform.
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>(iv) Risks Associated with Internet Currency:</strong> There are risks associated with
                        the use of Internet Currency, including, but not limited to, risks related to hardware,
                        software, and Internet connection being interrupted and the risk of third parties gaining
                        unauthorized access to information stored in your eWallet. You agree and acknowledge that we are
                        not responsible for any communication failures, interruptions, errors, outages, or delays you
                        experience while using the Binance smart chain, regardless of the cause.
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>(v) Regulatory Uncertainty:</strong> The regulatory environment related to blockchain
                        technology, cryptocurrencies, and tokens is uncertain, and any new regulations or policies could
                        have a material adverse effect on the development of the Hyper League ecosystem and, therefore,
                        on the potential usefulness or value of your Collections.
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>(vi) Software Risks:</strong> An upgrade to the Binance Smart Chain, a hard fork in the
                        Blockchain, or a change in the way transactions are validated on the blockchain could have an
                        unintended adverse impact on any network on the binance smart chain, including the Hyper League
                        ecosystem.

                    force majeure events ("Force Majeure Event(s)"), we will not be liable to you, nor shall we be
                    deemed to be in breach of them. (a) natural disasters; (b) floods, fires, earthquakes, epidemics,
                    pandemics, including the 2019 New Coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic, tsunami, explosions; (c) war,

                </p>
                <p><strong>(ii) The performance of our obligations in times of force majeure:</strong> In the event of
                    force majeure, we will use our best efforts to notify you immediately of the force majeure event and
                    specify the period during which the event is expected to continue. As far as possible, we will make
                    every effort to remedy the failure or delay and minimize the consequences of such force majeure.
                    Upon resolving the cause, we will resume our obligations as soon as possible. Suppose our failure or
                    delay is not remedied forty-five (45) consecutive days after our written notice in accordance with
                    clause 12. In that case, we may terminate these Terms and Conditions by giving fifteen (15) days

                    <li><strong>(iii) Interpretation:</strong> The wording of these Terms shall be construed in good
                        faith and not strictly for or against any party.
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>(iv) Severability:</strong> A severable provision of these Terms will remain valid and
                        enforceable if any part of them is found to be invalid, illegal, void, or unenforceable.
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>(v) No Exception:</strong> We shall not be deemed to have waived any right or provision
                        of these Terms and Conditions if we fail to exercise them or enforce them in the future. No
                        waiver of any right or provision of these Terms and Conditions shall be effective unless in
                        writing and signed on our behalf by a duly authorized representative.
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>(vi) Notices:</strong> We may send you notices (including, without limitation, notices
                        of changes to these Terms) by email or postings on the Platform. You agree that we may use that
                        address to send you notices by providing us with your email address. Email notices are effective
                        when they are sent, and postal mail notices are effective when they are mailed. You are
                        responsible for updating your email address.
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>(ix) Assignment:</strong> You may not assign your rights or obligations under these
                        Terms without our prior written consent, whether by operation of law or otherwise. A merger,
                        acquisition, or sale of our business may assign our rights and obligations under these Terms to
                        one of our affiliates. Neither party may assign these Terms or transfer them to any third party
                        without the prior written consent of the other.
                    </li>

                <ol>
                    <li>In the event that a term of these terms and conditions is deemed invalid according to law or
                        regulation, that will not affect the validity of other terms. These terms will remain in full
                        force and effect.
                    </li>
                    <li>There is no need to worry about terms and conditions that are considered inappropriate for a
                        user with certain provisions impacting other users.
